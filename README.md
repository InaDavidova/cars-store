A React App for selling used cars. It is for educational purposes only. The server was provided by my school SoftUni. I have build the client side.

In order to start the app:
- navigate to the <b>server</b> folder and run <code>node server.js</code> in order to start the server
- navigate to the <b>client</b> folder and run <code>npm run start</code> in order to start the client

The app will be available on <b>http://localhost:3000</b>
